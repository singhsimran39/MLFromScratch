# MLFromScratch
This repository contains a few Machine Learning algorithms that I have coded from scratch.
I have not used any existing libraries available in R.
All algorithms are fairly basic and have been built from first principles.

1) RegressionNN.R contains source code for a Back Prop based Neural Network. It uses the Auto dataset to predict mpg values using horsepower, weight, year and origin as predictor variables.
