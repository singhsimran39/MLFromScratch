# MLFromScratch
This repository contains a few Machine Learning algorithms that I have coded from scratch.
All algorithms are fairly basic and have been built from first principles.

1) Ensemble Methods:- 
---
	Contains implemetation of boosted decision stumps.

2) KNN:- 
---
	K Nearest Neighbour Implementation generalized for different values of K. 

3) NeuralNets:-
---
      NN.xlsx - is an excel sheet which can be used to test a Neural Net implementation. The implementation has input layer with 2 nodes, hidden layer with 2 nodes and ouput layer with 4 nodes. To test just enter the values of X, Y, W1(weights between i/p and hidden layer) and W2(weights between hidden and o/p layer). Activation function used is sigmoid and the network uses 3 training examples.  
      RegressionNN.R - Neural Network that learns on Back Propagation. The network uses horsepower, weight, year and origin predictors to predict the mpg value for the Auto dataset in R.  
      neuralTrain_MNIST.m - Classification Neural Network with 784 input units, 1 hidden layer and 10 output units.
